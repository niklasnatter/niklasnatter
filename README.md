**Hey there ðŸ‘‹** 

I am a full stack software developer and open source enthusiast. I enjoy building usable applications, working on challenging problems, experimenting with new technologies and tinkering with my shell configuration. I like to dive deep into libraries, frameworks and languages and tackling problems by solving their root cause. In my freetime, you can find me exploring new places by foot or mountains with my skis.
